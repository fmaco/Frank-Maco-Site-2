		<p>Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, commonly referred to simply as Fender, is a manufacturer of stringed instruments and amplifiers, such as solid-body electric guitars, including the Stratocaster and the Telecaster. It is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. The company, previously named the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, was founded in Fullerton, California, by Clarence Leonidas "Leo" Fender in 1946. Leo Fender also designed one of the first commercially successful solid-body electric basses, the Precision Bass (P-Bass), which has become known in rock, jazz, country, Motown, funk, and other types of music. Fender's Precision and Jazz Bass models are now widely considered to be <em>the standard to which most other electric bass guitars are measured.</em></p>

	<h2>News</h2>
		<div id="news_paragraph_container">
		<p>Fender’s acclaimed Pawn Shop instrument series welcomes three striking new instruments to the fold—including the family’s first bass guitar—and sees the return of an original member with a new look. It’s a sensational new generation of instruments that “never were but should have been”; once again drawing inspiration from the eccentric and innovative Fender creations of the mid-’60s-to-mid-’70s era.

		The new Pawn Shop instruments are the Offset Special and Jaguarillo guitars, and the Reverse Jaguar Bass. Further, the Mustang® Special carries on with a new Three-color Sunburst finish option.

		The Pawn Shop Offset Special guitar is undoubtedly one of the most offbeat Fender designs ever. With its sleekly offset semi-hollow body, elegant f hole, phenomenal-sounding JZHB humbucking pickups and Adjusto-Matic™ bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece, it’s a guitar from the past and the future.

		The sleek Pawn Shop Jaguarillo guitar hot-rods traditional Jaguar design through the roof with a scorching HSS configuration featuring standard Stratocaster® single-coil neck and middle pickups and a devastating Atomic humbucking bridge pickup, all angled for enhanced bass and treble response. Its streamlined control layout is easy to use, and it too has an Adjusto-Matic™ bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece.
